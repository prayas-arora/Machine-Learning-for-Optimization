# Machine Learning for Optimization
It is no exaggeration to say that optimization is needed everywhere, from engineering design to business planning and from Internet routing to holiday planning. Because resources, time, and money are always limited in real-world applications, we have to find solutions to optimally use these valuable resources under various constraints. Mathematical optimization or programming is the study of such planning and design problems using mathematical tools. Since most real-world applications are often highly nonlinear, they require sophisticated optimization tools to tackle. Nowadays, computer simulations become an indispensable tool for solving such optimization problems with various efficient search algorithms. Behind any computer simulation and computational methods, there are always some algorithms at work. The basic components and the ways they interact determine how an algorithm works and the efficiency and performance of the algorithm.

Under this light, I have implemented the following algorithms and techinques: Genetic Algorithms, Feature Selection Techniques, Neural Networks, Decison Trees, Least Sum Of Square Problem, Set Partion Problem, Operator Fitting.
